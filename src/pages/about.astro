          <p>
            I'm based in the NYC area and have been passionate about technology
            since childhood. My journey in software development began with
            robotics and Java programming, which laid the foundation for my
            technical skill set.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold a Computer Science degree from Penn State University, where I
            was selected for the Happy Valley LaunchBox accelerator to develop <Link

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              class="underline">Loancrunch</Link
            >, my first startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Capital One, I progressed from a full-stack developer focused on
            cloud resiliency to a Lead Software Engineer on the Model Training
            Infrastructure team. I was recognized in the Circle of Excellence
            for contributions to the Model Platform and earned three promotions
            in as many years.
          </p>
          <p>
            My contract work includes developing MyVoice, an ed-tech platform
            used by school districts nationwide, and creating custom Shopify
            integrations for e-commerce businesses with significant social media
            presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've built and scaled products that have
            generated millions of impressions across education, fintech,
            e-commerce, and enterprise software industries. My focus on
            user-centered design and scalable architecture has consistently
            delivered measurable business impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm the co-founder of <Link

              class="underline">New Memories</Link
            >, an AI-first product studio building solutions to enhance human
            experiences. I also serve as the Head of Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on software projects, you'll find me watching
            the Phillies or spending quality time with my wife and our Bernese
            Mountain Dog.
