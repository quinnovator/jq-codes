# Understanding Vector-Based Recommendation Systems

Modern recommendation systems often use vector embeddings to represent items and user preferences in a high-dimensional space. These systems work by converting text descriptions, user behaviors, or other features into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.

## How Vector Embeddings Work

At its core, a vector embedding is a mathematical representation of an item or preference in a multi-dimensional space. For example, an event might be represented as:

```typescript
const eventVector = [0.2, 0.8, -0.3, ...]; // typically 300-1000 dimensions
```

The position of these vectors in the high-dimensional space encodes semantic relationships - similar items will be closer together. We measure this similarity using cosine similarity:

$$
`similarity(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{||a|| \cdot ||b||}`
$$

## Available Events

Below is a table of events in our system, along with their descriptions. Each event has been embedded into a vector space that captures its semantic meaning:

<EventTable />

## Customizing Your Preferences

You can adjust your preferences using the sliders below. Each preference vector represents a different aspect of interest:

<PreferenceDemo />

The recommendations update in real-time as you adjust the sliders. The system calculates a weighted average of your preference vectors:

$$
`query = \frac{w_{outdoor}v_{outdoor} + w_{tech}v_{tech} + w_{art}v_{art}}{||w_{outdoor}v_{outdoor} + w_{tech}v_{tech} + w_{art}v_{art}||}`
$$

Where $w_i$ represents the weight (slider value) for each preference vector $v_i$.

## Dynamic Vector Weighting

While equal weighting of preference vectors is straightforward, we can make our system more sophisticated by dynamically adjusting weights based on user queries. This allows for more nuanced personalization.

### The Mathematics of Vector Weighting

When we have multiple preference vectors, we can combine them with different weights to create a final query vector:

$$
`query = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i v_i`
$$

The weights $w_i$ determine how much each preference vector contributes to the final query. These weights can be:

- Manually set (as in the demo above)
- Learned from user behavior
- Derived from natural language queries

### Query-Based Weight Generation

Try entering a natural language query below. Our system will analyze the query to determine appropriate weights for each preference vector:

<QueryDemo />

The system processes your query through a separate embedding model to determine how closely it aligns with each preference vector. The resulting weights are then used to create a weighted query vector:

$$
`w_i = \frac{similarity(query, v_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} similarity(query, v_j)}`
$$

## Advanced Weighting Demonstration

Experiment with different weighting schemes and see how they affect recommendations:

<WeightedDemo />

This demonstrates how the same preference vectors can yield different results based on their weights, allowing for dynamic personalization based on context or user intent.
