## Welcome

This is my first post here. My name is Jack, and I'm a software engineer from the New York City area. Although software is my profession, making things is something that I consider one of my core passions in life. I've been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember, and I love to build things just to try something new or pick up a new skill.

I'm mostly doing this for me, to be honest. I have wanted to jounral for a while, but I can't get into the whole "notes app" journal or pen and paper. I wanted to create this blog as a way to force myself to write and reflect.

I'll be writing about a wide range of topics, but I expect that software will be the most prevalent.

## A world of possibilities

Throughout my life, I have always loved to build things, take things apart, and figure out how they work. I've always been excited by the tremendous potential that lies within being a maker, being able to create something with a purpose and value of its own from previously unrelated parts.

When all of the components of a system are in place, I believe the product that results is an expression of creativity in its purest form.

When I first discovered software development, I was immediately drawn to it. I believe the factor that makes it particularly special is that the potential is enormous in terms of what one can create with a small amount of resources. With dedication and a sufficiently capable machine, a single person can create entire digital worlds or magnificently complex systems.

This potential is what first drew me into the craft and what keeps me interested today.

## How I apply my passion in practice

I've always been an early adopter. I think I owe that to my curious nature and my upbringing. My parents always encouraged me to pursue passions and interests of mine, even though I can confidently look back on those moments today and realize that many of those interests in my youth were particularly nonsensical.

I like to get a very wide range of experience with technologies. I think that having vast generalist knowledge can provide an important leg up in the industry. Perhaps for software, more than any other field, having a large breadth of knowledge can open a large range of opportunities.

What does this mean in practice? Well, for me, in particular, I learn by doing. This means that I'll find some kind of pain point in my life and build a solution for it that I can generalize. After all, I have always felt that the primary responsibility of an engineer is to improve overall efficiency, and if I can generalize a solution to a pain point, then I can amply the impact that my solution could have on the world in general.

Of course, there are a lot of steps between creating a fun project on my laptop and changing the world... The point I am tyring to make is that by thinking about problems from an abstract perspective, we can create solutions that can be built upon by others. That cycle is the core of innovation in my mind. In software, that cycle is accelerated to a dramatic degree.

## My pain points

One of my primary issues with wanting to try something new is the process involved in scaffolding a new application, deploying it, and setting up a cohesive CI/CD solution. This might sound silly at first. Why would anyone need these things if they just want to spin up an app?

Well, I don't really know. But it sure does bother me. I think I like to have things configured so that I can iterate on them as quickly as possible as to not lose interest. I feel like most of my side projects always end up getting abandoned because I can't figure out how to get a certain ingress resource working for a specific service, or can't find the necessary logs to solve a problem.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I think I've decided I want to take a stab at building something better.

## Future plans

To the above pain point, I would love to start working on a developer platform that is tailored for a single tenant. Something that's opinionated, capabale, and easy to use. There's a lot of work in this area focused on enterprise, but I think it's time we put some focus on tools that make our craft better, not just our companies more efficient.

If I pick something like this up, I'll be sure to write about it here. In the meantime, be well.

Thanks.

JQ
